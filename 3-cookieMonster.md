*Dev Notes:*
- If user has already submitted the email form, donâ€™t allow them to resubmit. Instead, show the message "Hmm, you look familiar. While you're waiting for our reply, here's a GIF we think you should see."
- GIF can be anything you desire.
- Styling of messaging is up to you.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.
