## Form validation
*Hypothesis:* Adding form validation to the "name" and "message" fields of the email form will increase form submissions.

*Device type:* Desktop only

*Dev notes:*
- Currently, the form only checks for a valid email address. 
- Please execute your code on DOM ready and use AJAX to handle validation.
- Styling/layout of error messaging is up to you.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.
