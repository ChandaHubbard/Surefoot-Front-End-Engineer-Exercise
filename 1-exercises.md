## Exercise 1: Form validation
*Hypothesis:* Adding form validation to the "name" and "message" fields of the email form will increase form submissions.

*Device type:* Desktop only  

*URL:* http://surefoot.staging.wpengine.com/engineer-test/  

*Dev notes:*
- Currently, the form only checks for a valid email address. 
- Please execute your code on DOM ready and use AJAX to handle validation.
- Styling/layout of error messaging is up to you.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.

## Exercise 2: Form restyling

*Hypothesis:* Swapping the position of the two forms and restyling the email form will increase email form submissions.

*Device type:* Desktop only

*URL:* http://surefoot.staging.wpengine.com/engineer-test/

*Mockup:* https://goo.gl/cboH7f

*Dev notes:*
- Swap the positions of the "schedule a call" and email forms.
- Restyle the form to resemble the mockup but don't worry too much about pixel perfection.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.

## Exercise 3: Cookie monster

*Hypothesis:* Disallowing return users to resubmit the email form will decrease spam.

*Device:* Desktop only

*URL:* http://surefoot.staging.wpengine.com/engineer-test/

*Dev Notes:*
- If user has already submitted the email form, donâ€™t allow them to resubmit. Instead, show the message "Hmm, you look familiar. While you're waiting for our reply, here's a GIF we think you should see."
- GIF can be anything you desire.
- Styling of messaging is up to you.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.


**Your code here:**

```
/* Cookie Monster Code */
