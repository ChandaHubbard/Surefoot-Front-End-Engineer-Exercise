*Device type:* Desktop only

*Mockup:* https://goo.gl/cboH7f

*Dev notes:*
- Swap the positions of the "schedule a call" and email forms
- Restyle the form to resemble the mockup but don't worry too much about pixel perfection
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person
